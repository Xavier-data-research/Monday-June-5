Notes, Thoughts, inner dialogue. I did not use grammarly or any text as I hope you can come out with your own take aways as I allow my thoughts to flow in the speaking of human nature and the future of technology. Linear thinking has no place in the AGI period.

Eugene Goostman, a chatbot created in ST. Petersburg, came close to passing the Turing test, in 2014 by using a personality trick.
What is intelligence? understanding how the Turing test was built to map out intelligence amongst bots it makes me wonder about SATs,
and other test that humans take. Preparing for systems that were placed at birth but like the Eugene Goostman, humans also manipulate to win. We use whatever tactics we can to get an advantage in any situation, but do we still know what intelligence is?

There is no clear definition of intelligence, that is one of the most important problems while most try to keep finding it. They create issues out of insecurities. Instead of using the resource of technology with assisting with the one brain that can think abstract and to understand its self-awarness. Reasoning and (Self-introspection) our subconsious distinguishes, the difference betweens animals and other things that our brands know the names for.

Like a baby when they begin to form a understanding for the world.

computers becoming humans or like humans, need to somehow be modeled internally with our way of thinking. We still need the understanding of what makes a human intelligent before moving forward with warp speed trying to develop something more powerful than the nuclear bomb. Programming intelligence requires the understanding of how decision making works.

Charles Babbage originally created the computer to operate on numbers following defined procedure (an Algorithm)
Modern computers follow the same idea of controlled computations but now with more energy to cause harm. Now there may not be away of. stopping consumers of AI doing what they want without harming the process of learning properly about how Artifical Intelligence and Human Intelligence works together in the future of mankind. 

As computers were created to their own algorithm frequency, as humans we have created our own societal codes that indeed hindered more of the percentage than we have helped. So the future of technology has a bit more weight this time around and it is very important things are fine tuned from warp speed and "racing" terms.
